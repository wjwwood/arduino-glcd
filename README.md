# gLCD

This is a fork of TCWORLD's gLCD library, downloaded from http://www.railways-in-miniature.co.uk/gLCD.zip.

I've updated it to work with Arduino >= 1.0 (I'm using 1.6.3).

## Usage

You can add this to your Arduino environment by putting these files in a `gLCD` folder within the `libraries` folder in your Arduino directory (mines in `~/Documents/Arduino`).

Then you can go to `File`->`Examples`->`gLCD`->`TestPattern` to try out the test pattern.
